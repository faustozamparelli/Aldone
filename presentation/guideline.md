# Presentation Guideline

- The entire presentation, independently of the number of group members, should not last more than 7 minutes;
- You can use any type of media you prefer, e.g. images/videos/etc., to make the presentation more catchy;
- You have to use your own device (laptop, tablet, whatsoever) for presenting;
