# Report Guideline

Together with the project code, you have to provide a report. I kindly ask you to respect the following structure:

1. Introduction: Provide a concise explanation of the topic that you have chosen, and what has been done already on such topic (maybe by putting some references).
2. Method: Here you will explain what you have done. I do not need the code since you will provide it together with the report. You just need to explain the several steps/the model that you have implemented, together with the used dataset.
3. Results: Here you will show the results that you got, and the problems you encountered.

In each of the 3 parts, you can use equation, images, whatever you like, to explain what you have done.

Finally, the report should be at least 4 pages long, and no more 10 pages long.
